# 500 Days of LeetCode Challenge

This repository is dedicated to my 500 days of continuous LeetCode challenge, starting from 19th December 2023.

## Goal

The main goal of this challenge is to improve my problem-solving skills by solving various problems on LeetCode for the next 500 days.

## Structure

Each day's work will be stored in a separate folder named with the format `DayXXX` where `XXX` is the day number. Each folder will contain the problem statement, my solution, and a brief explanation of the solution.

## Progress

| Day | Date               | Problem                                                                                                                  | Solution                                              |
